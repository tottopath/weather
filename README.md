This is a basic weather forecast HTML file that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to show the current weather at the user's location. The code displays the current weather, temperature, and a weather icon on a webpage. The Leaflet library is used to create a map that centers on the user's location. The user's location is obtained using the Geolocation API. The weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API and displayed on the page. The weather icon changes based on the temperature. The page also uses CSS to style the elements on the page.
